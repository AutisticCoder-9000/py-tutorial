The urgency to remember a dangerous experience requires the
brain to make a series of potentially dangerous moves:
Neurons and other brain cells snap open their DNA in numerous
locations – more than previously realized, according to a new
study – to provide quick access to genetic instructions for
the mechanisms of memory storage.

The extent of these DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in multiple
key brain regions is surprising and concerning, said study
senior author Li-Huei Tsai, Picower Professor of Neuroscience
at MIT and director of The Picower Institute for Learning and
Memory, because while the breaks are routinely repaired, that
process may become more flawed and fragile with age. Tsai's
lab has shown that lingering DSBs are associated with
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and that repair
mechanisms can falter.

Jupiter stirs up the asteroid belt through dynamical effects
called "mean motion resonances." A mean motion resonance happens
when the orbit of an asteroid has the right period so the
asteroid closely encounters a planet at the same location in the solar
system over and over again. When this happens between the asteroid and
Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational tugs on the asteroid add up and
reinforce each other, and they can easily boot the asteroid out of the
solar system. Astronomers believe that one reason Earth is habitable is
that the gravity of Jupiter does help protect us from some comets.
Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer
reaches. Jupiter’s gravity is thought to sling most of these fast-moving
ice balls out of the solar system before they can get close to Earth. So
long-period comets are thought to strike Earth only on very long
timescales of millions or tens of millions of years. Without Jupiter
nearby, long-period comets would collide with our planet much more
frequently.
